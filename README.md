# SEW5: Laravel Invoice Management

This is a school based project to learn laravel (from a C# ASP.net background) and primarily exists to help out others struggling with the framework.

Eventually, users should be able to access a REST API with CRUD operations - similar to https://github.com/S0urC10ud/SEW5-CarTelemetry.


_Hint: You need to add your own .env-File in the root-directory of the project_

In addition to the other above mentioned repository, this one also contains many functionalities of JQuery like Input-Formatting, Filtering, Searching a DataTable, ... Autonumeric and MomentJS are also used.
